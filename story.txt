Palm Tree lived on a deserted island. He had always loved it's beautiful burnt beach, but he was utterly alone. 
Day in and day out he stood, watching the waves, feeling the wind, waiting for something more.
Until one day, when a spiteful monster with wobby tenticles and slimy palms washed up on the beach.
Palm tree gulped. 
The monster drew closer, hefting itself across the rocks, and shifting sands.

Monster looked fuzzy, his emotions blushing like a homeless, hard hat.
Then the monster came inside for a nice glass of port.
