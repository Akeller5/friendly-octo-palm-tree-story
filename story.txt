Palm Tree lived on a deserted island. He had always loved it's beautiful burnt beach, but he was utterly alone. 
Day in and day out he stood, watching the waves, feeling the wind, waiting for something more.
Until one day, when a spiteful monster with wobby tenticles and slimy palms washed up on the beach.
Palm Tree gulped. 
The monster drew closer, hefting itself across the rocks, and shifting sands.

The monster looked fuzzy, his emotions blushing like a homeless, hard hat.
The monster introduced herself: "What's poppin'? My name is Octo."
Palm Tree was relieved.

Octo came inside for a nice glass of port at Palm Tree's recommendation.
Palm Tree and Octo shared a sirloin steak and became great friends, telling stories from their childhoods.
Soon it was late, but Octo didn't want to leave.
The two friends devised a plan.
